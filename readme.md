## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the design of a **planetary gear system** (also known as an epicyclic gear train) with a **gear reduction ratio of 1:6**.  

Planetary gears are widely used in robotics, automotive transmissions, and industrial applications due to their **compactness, efficiency, and high torque density**.  

This project demonstrates a **CAD model** of a planetary gear set created for educational and prototyping purposes.

## ⚙️ Features
- **1:6 Gear Ratio** (input-to-output speed reduction).  
- **Planetary Gear Train** composed of:
  - **Sun Gear** (center input).  
  - **Planet Gears** (three equally spaced).  
  - **Ring Gear** (internal gear with outer housing).  
  - **Carrier Plate** (holds planets and transmits output).  
- **Compact cylindrical housing** with bolt mounts.  
- **Scalable design** for use in robotics and mechanical projects.
